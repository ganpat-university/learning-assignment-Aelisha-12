	<h1>Waterfall Model of Software Development</h1>

	<p>The Waterfall Model was the first Process Model to be introduced. It is also referred to as a linear-sequential
		life cycle model. It is very simple to understand and use. In a waterfall model, each phase must be completed
		before the next phase can begin and there is no overlapping in the phases. </p>

	<p>The Waterfall model is the earliest SDLC approach that was used for software development.</p>

	<p> The waterfall Model illustrates the software development process in a linear sequential flow. This means that
		any phase in the development process begins only if the previous phase is complete. In this waterfall model, the
		phases do not overlap.</p>

	<h3>Waterfall Model - Design</h3>

	<p>Waterfall approach was first SDLC Model to be used widely in Software Engineering to ensure success of the
		project. In "The Waterfall" approach, the whole process of software development is divided into separate phases.
		In this Waterfall model, typically, the outcome of one phase acts as the input for the next phase sequentially.
	</p>
	<p>The following illustration is a representation of the different phases of the Waterfall Model.</p>
